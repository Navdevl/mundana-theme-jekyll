Hello devs! This article is solely written for Django devs, but other devs can also make use of the benefits of CTEs in a lot of scenearios.

# So what is CTE?
Few databases provides a way to store temporary results in a label(named dataset), that can be reused in the following queries. There are tons of articles written to explain CTE, but still here‚Äôs my part.

When I was explaining the same to my good old friend about Common Table Expression, she was like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just use derived table for this. Why CTE?‚Äù. So, yes! There is a benefit of using CTE over derived table.

Let‚Äôs check the following derived table approach.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT id, name FROM students where category == 'engineering') 
  as EngineeringStudents;
{% endhighlight %}

Now let us see how the sample above implemention can be approached using CTE.

{% highlight sql %}
WITH EngineeringStudents(id, name) AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT id, name FROM students where category == 'engineering') 
)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT * FROM EngineeringStudents;
{% endhighlight %}

You might be asking, what is happening other than 2 extra lines in CTE?
*might also be with a rolling eyes.*

The improvement over the first and latter is the readability and the reusability. Wondering how that is possible?
Incase of multiple joins and some complex queries, you can easily do a magic like the one below.

{% highlight sql %}
WITH EngineeringStudents(id, name) AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT id, name FROM students where category == 'engineering') 
)
SELECT es1.id, es2.id FROM EngineeringStudents as es1 
INNER JOIN EngineeringStudents as es1
ON es1.id = es2.parent_id 
WHERE es1.parent_id = NULL;
{% endhighlight %}

If you really wanted me to explain the above SQL, you might need to brush up your SQL skills forehand.

So, yes! CTE is really a friendly choice to take.

## Now taking it to our Django part
I was working on an application where we have Categories and these categories have subcategories and the depth goes on.

The python (fake) model looks like below.

{% highlight python %}
class Category(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=150, blank=True)
  parent = models.ForeignKey('Category', null=True, blank=True)
{% endhighlight %}

Now, given a category, I wanted to print all of it‚Äôs subcategories and their subcategories and so on. i.e, I wanted to print their descendants.

Don‚Äôt judge my code below. That was my naivest approach.

{% highlight python %}
def get_descendants(root_category):
    categories = []
    for category in root_category.category_set.all():
        categories.extend(get_descendants(category))
    return categories
{% endhighlight %}

Do you know the number of DB calls this function was making? A lot. Too many.
If the depth of categories are M and the width is N, our function was making M+N calls to DB. I was like üò≠

## To the rescue
Then CTE came to the rescue. CTE has an awesome way to handle this problem using WITH RECURSIVE.
You can read more on this here [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/queries-with.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/queries-with.html)

I‚Äôll share the code snippet with you, and you guys do homework on that. (Not explaining this. Because this is your homework. Still, you can DM me on this and I can explain you if you are really really interested.)

{% highlight python %}
categories = Category.objects.raw('''
    WITH RECURSIVE parent_category(id, parent_id) AS (
          SELECT category.id, category.parent_id
          FROM category
          WHERE id in %s
        UNION ALL
          SELECT child_category.id, child_category.parent_id
          FROM category AS child_category, parent_category
          WHERE child_category.parent_id = parent_category.id
        )
    SELECT * FROM parent_category;
    ''', params=[tuple(root_category_id)])
{% endhighlight %}
