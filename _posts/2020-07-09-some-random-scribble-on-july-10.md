_This is a completely random scribble that I am writing without any efforts put in to the words. Just leaks from the mind poured out on the keyboards._

Nothingness.

Feeling rugged.

Too many thoughts. Too much noise.

Overwhelmed by other's works, nothing on my slate looks like I could take pride in.

Feeling distracted. Alone, sometimes.

Just random hormone playing wrong games.

Might delete this later when I feel so.
