Recently, I am seeing a lot of support for the posts that pick scenes from movies that range from 2000 till now, and rant about how sexist the scenes are, how comedies are made out of body shaming and a huge list of rant goes on and on.

This writing of mine isn't a rant. I don't prefer to rant, actually. But I am just writing and making note of the opinions I am having on May 2nd 2020. (Yes, this is when the quarantine was going on)
